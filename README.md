👋 Hi, I’m Kruti Agarwal

🎮 Software Developer with hands-on experience in game development and a strong foundation in programming and system-driven thinking.

💻 I’ve worked on interactive and real-time applications, building features that involve state management, event-driven logic, and performance optimization.

🚀 Currently building projects with React and modern JavaScript, while transitioning my experience toward full-stack and backend-oriented software development.

🧠 Interested in collaborating on software or game-related projects that emphasize clean architecture, scalability, and real-world problem solving.
